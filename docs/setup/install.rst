Installation
=============

This guide assumes you have a working Tripal site. **Tripal Core is required**.

1. Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See: https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7 for further information.

2. Enable the module in "Admin menu > Site building > Modules" (path /admin/modules).

.. note::

  This module adds the **Multi-Crop Passport Descriptor (MCPD) Controlled Vocabulary** to your Tripal site. An up-to-date version is required.

  .. warning::

    In case you have an obsolete version of the MCPD vocabulary, you may need to update it using the button "Reload Chado MCPD CV" in the MCPD Settings section of admin/tripal/extension/brapi/configuration page.
