Tripal BrAPI's documentation!
==============================

This is an implementation of the `Breeding API <http://docs.brapi.apiary.io/>`_ which uses Tripal to expose data in your Chado database.

The Breeding API specifies a standard interface for plant phenotype/genotype databases to serve their data to crop breeding applications. It is a shared, open API, to be used by all data providers and data consumers who wish to participate. Initiated in May 2014, it is currently being actively developed, so now is the time for potential participants to help shape the specifications to ensure their needs are addressed. The listserve for discussions and announcements is at `Cornell University <http://mail2.sgn.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/plant-breeding-api>`_. Additional documentation is in the `Github wiki <https://github.com/plantbreeding/documentation>`_. The latest up-to-date specifications and discussions can be found on the `git repository <https://github.com/plantbreeding/API>`_ and the `issue queue <https://github.com/plantbreeding/API/issues>`_.
